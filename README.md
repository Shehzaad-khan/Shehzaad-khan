## 🎯 About Me

Third-year CS student at **PES University** with a passion for building intelligent systems that scale. I work at the intersection of **systems engineering** and **machine learning** — from kernel modules to neural networks.

**What drives me:** Understanding the *why* behind the *how*. Whether debugging distributed systems or training models, I think in first principles.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🎮 [HangmanMind — AI Game-Playing Agent](https://github.com/moaahil1110/Machine-Learning-Hackathon-Hangman)
**94.40% win rate** on unseen games using hybrid intelligence:
- Combined Hidden Markov Models, dynamic word filtering, and Deep Q-Networks
- Adaptive strategy blending (HMM 30% + Word Filter 50% + RL 20%)
- Zero repeated guesses, 2.13 avg wrong attempts

*Pure RL achieved 7.18%. Adding domain knowledge → 94.40%. Sometimes smart AI knows when to use rules.*

**Tech:** PyTorch, HMM, DQN, Reinforcement Learning

---

### 🌊 [MetricFlow — Real-Time Distributed Monitoring](https://github.com/Shehzaad-khan/kafka-spark-metrics-pipeline)
Production-grade monitoring system handling **1000+ events/sec** with sub-second latency:
- Kafka → Spark Streaming → Windowed Analytics → Intelligent Alerting
- Multi-metric correlation (CPU + Memory = real problems)
- Fault-tolerant with ZooKeeper coordination and automatic rebalancing
- Secure multi-machine deployment via ZeroTier VPN

*Detects degradation before users notice.*

**Tech:** Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming, Python, ZooKeeper

---

### 🗂️ Mini HDFS — Distributed File System from Scratch
Built core HDFS primitives to understand distributed storage:
- Namenode-Datanode architecture with 2MB chunking
- 2x replication with exponential backoff and automatic recovery
- Heartbeat monitoring (5s intervals) + failure detection
- Custom TCP protocol with length-prefixed framing
- Flask dashboard for real-time visualization

*Most use HDFS. Few understand why it works this way.*

**Tech:** Python, TCP Sockets, Multi-threading, Flask

---

### 🐧 Linux Process Memory Tracker
Kernel-level introspection to understand memory management:
- Custom kernel module with process lifecycle hooks
- Parsed `/proc/[pid]/maps` and `/proc/[pid]/smaps` for memory regions
- Tracked RSS, dirty pages, heap allocations across `fork()` boundaries
- Visualized virtual → physical memory mapping

*Can debug at the kernel level when higher-level tools fail.*

**Tech:** C, Linux Kernel Modules, /proc filesystem

---

### 📈 MarketPulse — Time Series Stock Analysis
Statistical rigor meets forecasting:
- Seasonal decomposition (trend + seasonality + residuals)
- SARIMA modeling with ADF stationarity testing
- Markov Chain volatility analysis
- Not just sklearn predictions — proper statistical validation

**Tech:** Python, Pandas, Statsmodels, SARIMA
